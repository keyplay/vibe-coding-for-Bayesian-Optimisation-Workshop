# 🎉 Bayesian Optimisation Workshop Notebooks

## General Information

This repository contains notebooks and hackathons on the subject of Bayesian Optimisation. The notebook content is roughly divided into three sections: (i) Intuition and Mathematics behind Bayesian Optimisation (ii) Bayesian Optimisation for Chemical Reaction Optimisation and (iii) Bayesian Optimisation with BOTorch.

**Authors:**

- [Yong Lee](https://www.optimlpse.co.uk/author/yong-lee/) 

📅 Participants should have received a **preliminary schedule**. Any updates or changes will be communicated.

## Hackathon Submission

Paste your code into a .txt file (instead of a .py file) and send it via email to the following email: yl5119@imperial.ac.uk

## Teaching Material and Instructions

The following notebooks and excersises were created by Yong Lee with a section of code adapted from [OptiML PSE Group](https://github.com/OptiMaL-PSE-Lab) !

🖥️ For software requirements, please refer to the [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md).

Alternatively - you can run the notebooks on Google Colab!
